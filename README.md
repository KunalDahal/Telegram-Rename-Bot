# Telegram Rename Bot

A Telegram video renamer built with Pyrogram and FFmpeg. Reply to a supported
video in an allowed group, choose an output filename, and receive the finished
file in your private chat with the bot.

The bot is designed for rename workflows: it preserves the source streams where
possible, while still supporting metadata, custom thumbnails, MediaInfo,
watermarks, and ordered batch processing.

## What it can do

- Rename individual video files and supported video documents.
- Rename a Telegram media album or a sequence of up to 150 messages.
- Build batch names with `{season}` and `{episode}`, including zero-padded
  episode numbers.
- Save per-user settings, thumbnails, and watermark fonts in MongoDB.
- Add title, author, artist, encoder, and other metadata without unnecessary
  video re-encoding.
- Generate a Telegraph-hosted MediaInfo page from a replied media file.
- Queue work globally, show live task status, and cancel queued or running jobs.
- Recover active task records after an unexpected restart.
- Restrict access to bootstrap owners and MongoDB-managed administrators.
- Optionally use a Telegram Premium user session for downloads up to 4 GiB.

## Supported input formats

`.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.webm`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.mpeg`, `.mpg`, `.wmv`, `.flv`, and
`.3gp`.

## Commands

Commands use the numeric `COMMAND_POSTFIX` configured for the bot. With the
default value `0`, use `/rename`; with `COMMAND_POSTFIX=2`, use `/rename2`.
Every command below follows this rule.

| Command | Aliases | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/start` | `/help` | Open the bot help message. |
| `/rename <filename>` | `/r <filename>` | Reply to one video and queue a rename. If the filename is omitted, the original name is retained. |
| `/rename -b <template>` | `/r -b <template>` | Reply to the first item of a media album and batch-rename it. |
| `/rename -b <count> <template>` | `/r -b <count> <template>` | Rename the next 2–150 messages beginning at the replied file. |
| `/es` | `/us`, `/settings`, `/usersettings` | Open personal rename, metadata, thumbnail, send-mode, and watermark settings. |
| `/ss <episode>` | `/set_start_episode <episode>` | Set the starting episode number for batch names; `/ss 001` preserves the padding. |
| `/st` | `/setthumb` | Reply to an image to save it as your output thumbnail. |
| `/status` | `/s` | Show task queue status and task IDs. |
| `/cancel <task_id>` | `/c <task_id>` | Cancel one queued or running task. |
| `/mi` | — | Reply to media to generate a MediaInfo page. |
| `/restart` | — | Cancel tasks, remove task records and temporary files, then restart the bot. Available to authorized users. |

### Bootstrap-owner commands

Only IDs listed in `OWNER_IDS` can use these commands.

| Command | Legacy alias | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/add_admin <user_id>` | `/add_workers <user_id>` | Grant MongoDB-backed administrator access. |
| `/remove_admin <user_id>` | `/remove_workers <user_id>` | Revoke an administrator's access. Bootstrap owners cannot be removed. |
| `/list_admin` | `/view_workers` | List administrators. |

## Rename examples

Reply to a video in an allowed group:

```text
/rename Movie.Name.2026.mkv
/rename "Movie Name 2026.mkv"
```

Reply to the first file in an album:

```text
/rename -b [S{season}-E{episode}] Show Name.mkv
```

Reply to the first of six sequential messages:

```text
/rename -b 6 [S{season}-E{episode}] Show Name.mkv
```

Only `{season}` and `{episode}` are supported in batch templates. Set the
starting episode with `/ss`; season and other preferences are available in the
settings panel.

> The bot must be started in private chat before a user queues work from a
> group, because finished files are delivered by DM.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- FFmpeg available on `PATH` (Docker installs it automatically)

Copy the example file and fill in the values:

```bash

```

Never commit `.env`, bot tokens, MongoDB credentials, or `SESSION_STRING`.
They are already excluded by `.gitignore`.

## Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KunalDahal/Telegram-Rename-Bot.git
cd Telegram-Rename-Bot
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Windows PowerShell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies and start the bot:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

## Docker

With `.env` in the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

View logs with:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

The compose configuration persists `src/bin` for local logs and active work
files. MongoDB stores administrators, user settings, thumbnails, watermark
fonts, and task records.

## Heroku deployment

Open [deploy_heroku.ipynb](deploy_heroku.ipynb) in Google Colab or a compatible
Jupyter environment. It provides an interactive control center to:

1. Connect your Heroku account using an API key.
2. Create one or more container-stack apps.
3. Add the bot configuration as Heroku config vars through masked form inputs.
4. Deploy this repository and stream application logs.

Push your current code to GitHub before deploying—the notebook clones the
repository and branch you select (default: `master`).

### Multiple bots and dynos

Use one Heroku app and exactly one worker dyno per `BOT_TOKEN`. Telegram's
long-polling API does not permit two running workers for the same token.

For multiple bots, create one app per distinct token. They may share a MongoDB
cluster, but each must have a different `MONGO_DB_NAME`, for example
`renamer_bot_1` and `renamer_bot_2`. `COMMAND_POSTFIX` only changes command
names; it does not make duplicate workers for a token safe.

Heroku's filesystem is ephemeral. Downloaded work files are not durable across
a dyno replacement, but MongoDB-backed administrators, user settings,
thumbnails, watermark fonts, and task records persist.

## Premium download session

The standard bot client can download files up to 2 GiB. Set `SESSION_STRING` in
`.env` or as a Heroku config var to use a Telegram Premium user account for
downloads up to 4 GiB. The account must be Premium and able to access the
source chats. Leave `SESSION_STRING` empty to use normal bot downloads.

This setting affects downloads only. It does not give users access to the
Premium account or change where renamed files are sent.
